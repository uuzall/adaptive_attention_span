Rachel Green: You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?
Ross Geller: That's what it seemed like.
Rachel Green: I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.
Ross Geller: Fine, then why didn't you say something?
Rachel Green: Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!
Ross Geller: Rach!
Rachel Green: What?
Ross Geller: You keep, you keep... You can't...
Rachel Green: WHAT?

Phoebe Buffay: All right, here it goes...
Joey Tribbiani: Doesn't work...

Monica Geller: Erica, are you okay?
Erica: Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach-aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
Monica Geller: Oh my God!
Chandler Bing: Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
Monica Geller: She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!
Chandler Bing: Oh my God!
Rachel Green: So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.
Ross Geller: Rach!
Rachel Green: What?!

Erica: No, I'm okay.
Monica Geller: Alright, I'll be right back.
Chandler Bing: Where are you going?
Monica Geller: To use the bathroom.
Chandler Bing: You can't leave me alone with her.
Monica Geller: What?
Chandler Bing: This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
Monica Geller: What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
Chandler Bing: It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
Monica Geller: You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
Chandler Bing: Okay.
Chandler Bing: So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
Erica: I don't know. Maybe church-camp?
Chandler Bing: Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
Erica: What?
Chandler Bing: Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
Chandler Bing: One of life GENERATED:
