 put her on my bed.
Ross Geller: No, she was definitely on my bed.
Chandler Bing: Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
Ross Geller: Well, then who was on my bed?
Monica Geller: OH! Oh, oh!
Ross Geller: NO! No, no!
Monica Geller: YES!
Ross Geller: You were under the pile of coats?
Monica Geller: I was the pile of coats!
Ross Geller: OH MY GOD!
Monica Geller: You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
Ross Geller: You were my first kiss with Rachel?
Monica Geller: You were my first kiss ever?
Chandler Bing: What did I marry into?

Phoebe Buffay: Oh, hey Joey.
Joey Tribbiani: Uh, hey.
Phoebe Buffay: Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.
Joey Tribbiani: Yeah.
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.
Joey Tribbiani: So he can't come?
Phoebe Buffay: No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
Joey Tribbiani: Seriously?
Phoebe Buffay: Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...
Joey Tribbiani: I am pretty wisdomous.
Phoebe Buffay: So... what do you say?
Joey Tribbiani: Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.
Joey Tribbiani: Listen, I hope... that you know... I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!

Phoebe Buffay: Oh.
Joey Tribbiani: Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, it's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy! Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!
Monica Geller: Well, it matters to me!
Phoebe Buffay: Well, I don't care, so you pick!
Monica Geller: Did you just hung up on me? All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.
Monica Geller: You don't know military time?
Phoebe Buffay: Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
Monica Geller: Just subtract twelve.
Phoebe Buffay: Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...
Monica Geller: Six o'clock!
Phoebe Buffay: Ok.
Monica Geller: Ok. Hold on. Geller here! No! I said it has to be there by 4 o'clock. Goodbye. Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
Phoebe Buffay: Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.
Monica Geller: Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
Phoebe Buffay: What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
Monica Geller: Ooh... she backed out.
Phoebe Buffay: She did? Why?
Monica Geller: I made her. Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
Phoebe Buffay: Hey! She will shower when Tibet is free.

Chandler Bing: Hey!
Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Chandler Bing: You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, what did we say was your one gift to GENERATED:

Phoebe Buffay: Oh, I did last rtrim.
Rachel Green: I care of those two t-Hicks!? Oh,
