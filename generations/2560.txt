Phoebe Buffay: This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. But you obviously haven't.
Clerk: How can I help you?
Phoebe Buffay: I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law. You're fun.
Clerk: You need to fill out this form.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?
Clerk: It can be anything you want.
Phoebe Buffay: Well, not anything, I mean...
Clerk: Yeah... anything.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, this could take a while.
Clerk: Get out of my line.
Phoebe Buffay: Okay.

Phoebe Buffay: Hey!
Monica Geller: Hey Pheebs.
Phoebe Buffay: Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.
Monica Geller: Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
Phoebe Buffay: Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
Chandler Bing: That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Monica Geller: Phoebe!
Phoebe Buffay: Uh! Princess Consuela.
Monica Geller: You seriously changed your name to that?
Phoebe Buffay: Uh-huh!
Monica Geller: Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
Phoebe Buffay: Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
Chandler Bing: Hey, how'd the interview go?
Rachel Green: Oh! It's not good.
Chandler Bing: You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
Rachel Green: Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
Chandler Bing: That is a bad interview.
Phoebe Buffay: What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?
Rachel Green: Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
Monica Geller: Oh God. I'm so sorry.
Ross Geller: Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
Phoebe Buffay: Ross...
Ross Geller: I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
#ALL#: Congratulations!
Ross Geller: This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
Gunther: Six? You want me to join you?
Ross Geller: Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
Chandler Bing: Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
Ross Geller: I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
Rachel Green: Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
 GENERATED: 
Monica Geller: Uh, ah queen?
