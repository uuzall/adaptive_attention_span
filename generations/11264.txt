!?
Monica Geller: I don't know why.
Janice Litman Goralnik: Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it! Ellen, we're going to talk numbers.
Chandler Bing: This can not be happening!
Monica Geller: Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
Chandler Bing: The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
Monica Geller: Okay, Okay, All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.
Chandler Bing: That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?
Monica Geller: Okay, you come up with an idea.
Chandler Bing: Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
Monica Geller: But we love our house.
Chandler Bing: Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and "Oh My God"!
Monica Geller: Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.
Chandler Bing: Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. Oh, that does it too.

Mr. Zelner: Who is it?
Ross Geller: It's me. Ron. Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
Mr. Zelner: This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job.
Ross Geller: Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise?
Mr. Zelner: Not good, Ron.
Ross Geller: Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.
Mr. Zelner: Wow, that's pretty cool.
Ross Geller: Huh? So? We have a deal?
Mr. Zelner: Okay, you got it.
Ross Geller: Yes! yes!
Mr. Zelner: This is gonna make me very popular.
Ross Geller: Oh, Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
Mr. Zelner: I meant with my son.
Ross Geller: Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much.
